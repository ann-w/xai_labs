## Introduction

Explainable AI (XAI) focuses on the transparency and understandability of AI model decisions, fostering trust among users. By making complex AI processes clear and comprehensible, XAI addresses the need for fairness, ethical assurance, and regulatory compliance, particularly in sensitive domains. In this XAI lab, you will experiment with different XAI methods on tabular, image and text data.

## Instructions

1. Open xai_lab.ipynb.
2. On the top right, make sure compute is 'lab-compute' and the kernel is python_group{your_group_number}
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook. Feel free to run the three sections (tabular, text, image) in any order you want.

Goodluck!
